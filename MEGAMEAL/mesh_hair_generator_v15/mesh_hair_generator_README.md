## 🎨 Advanced Workflows

### Custom Object Hair
1. **Create your hair object** (grass blade, flower, etc.)
2. **Set Render As** to "Object"
3. **Select your object** in "Instance Object"
4. **Adjust scale and rotation** settings
5. **Generate hair** - each strand uses your custom object

### Guide Curve Control
1. **Create curve objects** to guide hair direction
2. **Add guide curves** in the addon panel
3. **Set influence** values for each guide
4. **Hair will follow** the curve directions

### Texture Color Matching
1. **Ensure your emitter has UV mapping** and materials
2. **Enable "Use Surface Color"**
3. **Adjust "Surface Color Blend"** to control texture influence
4. **Hair automatically samples** colors from the underlying texture

### Large-Scale Generation
1. **Enable "Use Batching"** for counts > 10,000
2. **Set appropriate batch size** based on your RAM
3. **Use fewer segments** (1-2) for better performance
4. **Monitor progress** in the console output

## 🔧 Performance Optimization

### Memory Management
- **Use batching** for large operations (>5,000 hairs)
- **Reduce segments** for simple geometry
- **Limit children count** for very dense hair
- **Close other applications** for maximum available RAM

### Speed Optimization
- **Start with preview mode** to test settings
- **Use lower hair counts** during development
- **Single segments** for ultra-fast generation
- **Disable children** for initial testing

### Batch Size Guidelines
| Hair Count | Recommended Batch Size | RAM Usage |
|------------|------------------------|-----------|
| 10,000 | 5,000 | Low |
| 50,000 | 3,000 | Medium |
| 100,000+ | 2,000 | High |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No preview hair found"**
- Generate hair first, then try to finalize

**"Emitter has no active UV map"**
- Add UV mapping to your emitter object
- Unwrap the mesh in Edit mode

**Hair appears white/wrong colors**
- Check that emitter has materials with textures
- Ensure "Use Surface Color" is enabled
- Verify UV mapping is correct

**Blender becomes unresponsive**
- Reduce hair count or enable batching
- Lower batch size for your system's RAM
- Use fewer segments and children

**Hair grows in wrong direction**
- Check mesh normals (Edit mode > Mesh > Normals > Recalculate Outside)
- Ensure surface normals point outward

### Performance Issues
- **Enable batching** for large operations
- **Reduce hair count** for testing
- **Use preview mode** during development
- **Close other applications** to free RAM
- **Restart Blender** if memory becomes fragmented
