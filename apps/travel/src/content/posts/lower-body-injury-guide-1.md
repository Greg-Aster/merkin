You're going to be far from a clinic. Cell coverage on the PCT is patchy at best, and the nearest town can be 50 miles away. When something goes wrong with your knees, ankles, or shins — and statistically, something will — you need to be able to identify what's happening, decide how serious it is, and take the right action on the spot.

This guide covers the injuries that actually end thru-hikes, how to tell them apart from normal soreness, and what you can do about them in the field.

**It comes in two versions — pick the one that works for you:**

> 📖 **Plain Talk Version** — starts right below this introduction. Written like your buddy who hiked the PCT twice is explaining it around a campfire. Same information, no jargon, no anatomy vocabulary. Start here if you just want to understand what's going on and what to do about it.

> 🔬 **Technical Reference** — starts after the plain talk section, marked clearly with a divider. Uses proper anatomical terms, injury grades, and clinical distinctions. Use this if you have a medical background, are looking up a specific condition by name, or want the full detail behind the plain-language version.

Both sections cover identical injuries in the same order. You don't need to read both — just pick your version and go.

# Plain Talk Version

*Same info, no jargon. Written like a buddy who's been there.*

## The Big Picture First, My Dude

Here's the thing about getting hurt on trail. There are basically two types of hurt.

**The first type sneaks up on you.** Shin splints, knee stuff, tendon problems — these don't just happen out of nowhere. Your body's been dropping hints for miles. These are the injuries where if you listen early, you're back to full speed in a few days. If you ignore them and try to be a hero, you're hitching a ride to the nearest town and sitting in an urgent care waiting room.

**The second type is sudden.** You roll your ankle on a rock, something pops, you're on the ground. These you deal with in the moment and then make a hard call about whether you keep going.

The difference between hikers who finish the PCT and hikers who don't usually isn't fitness. It's knowing which kind of hurt you're dealing with and being honest about it. Ego gets more people off trail than injury does.

## Part 1: Knee Stuff

![Knee pain is the most common reason thru-hikers leave the PCT early](https://www.rvpt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hiking-knee-pain.jpg)

### The Outer Knee Burn — IT Band

There's a thick band of tissue that runs down the outside of your thigh all the way to your knee. When you're hammering downhill miles day after day, it starts rubbing against a bony bit on the outside of your knee and gets mad about it.

**What it feels like:** Sharp, burning pain on the *outside* of your knee. The sneaky thing is it usually doesn't show up at mile one — you'll feel totally fine, then somewhere around mile 8 or 12 it starts complaining. Gets worse going downhill. Rarely bothers you going uphill.

**Why it happens:** Your hip muscles are a little weak and lazy, so your knee is doing extra work to compensate. The pain is in your knee but the real problem is tightness higher up the thigh. Classic misdirection.

**What to do:**
- Get your trekking poles out and actually use them going downhill — this is the biggest thing you can do
- Take smaller steps going down, stop trying to cover ground fast on descents
- Rub and squeeze the outside of your thigh all the way from hip to knee — not just the knee itself
- Stretch: stand sideways, cross your bad leg behind your good leg, and lean away until you feel a pull down the outer thigh
- Cold creek water on the knee, ibuprofen, rest

**Real talk:** This one tends to sort itself out around weeks 3-4 as your body toughens up — but only if you don't keep going full send while it's flaring. Back off a little, let it settle, then ramp back up.

---

### Kneecap Grind — Front of Knee

Your kneecap is supposed to slide smoothly in a little groove when you bend and straighten your knee. When something's off — usually because certain thigh muscles are weaker than others, or your pack is heavy — the kneecap starts grinding instead of gliding.

**What it feels like:** Dull, achy pain under or around your kneecap. The worst moment is when you've been sitting for a while and stand up — your knee is stiff and grumpy. Going downstairs or downhill is way worse than going up. Sometimes you feel a grinding sensation when you move the knee.

**What to do:**
- Trekking poles on every single descent — non-negotiable
- Get a knee sleeve with a hole cut out where the kneecap is — that little cutout actually helps the kneecap track better; a plain sleeve is okay but this is better
- Take shorter steps downhill, keep your knee slightly bent when your foot hits the ground — never let it go fully straight on impact
- Skip deep squats while this is happening
- Elevate your legs and ice the knee at camp

---

### Inner Knee Pinch — MCL

There's a ligament on the inside of your knee that keeps things from wobbling sideways. Uneven terrain, tired legs, and one bad step can stretch it.

**What it feels like:** Pain right on the inner side of your knee, at the joint itself. Sometimes a pinching sensation, like something's getting caught. Tender when you press on it. On uneven ground it might feel a little wobbly or uncertain.

**How bad is it? Quick gauge:**
- Aches but you can walk normally and the knee feels solid — probably okay to keep going carefully
- More painful, some swelling, feels a little unstable — slow way down and take it easy for a day or two
- Can't trust it, obviously unstable, significant swelling — time to get off trail, my man

**What to do:**
- Compression sleeve — actually helps stabilize this one
- Poles on anything uneven
- Stay on flatter, more predictable ground while it's angry
- Ice and feet up at camp

---

### The Deep Knee Pain — Cartilage

Inside your knee there are two little cushions made of cartilage that sit between your thigh bone and shin bone. They take a beating on long miles with a heavy pack.

**What it feels like:** Pain right in the *crease* of your knee — the joint line itself, not above or below it. Worse when you twist or do a deep squat. The really alarming thing is if your knee starts locking up — like it gets stuck and won't fully straighten for a second. Also watch for your knee feeling puffy and full from the inside, not just regular surface swelling.

**What to do:**
- This one doesn't respond to toughing through it — rest is the actual treatment
- No deep squats, no twisting
- Trekking poles
- If it keeps locking up, that's your body saying get off trail and get it looked at

> ⚠️ **Knee locking up and not releasing, or the inside of the joint feeling swollen and tight = get out and get it checked, dude. Not negotiable.**

---

### Back of Knee Ache

Sometimes the pain is right behind the knee — in the crease. This is usually your hamstring tendons complaining, or fluid building up back there. A soft lump behind the knee that gets bigger after activity sounds scary but is usually just fluid — not dangerous.

**What to do:**
- Rest and elevation — responds well to just taking it easy
- Stretch your hamstrings gently: stand and reach toward your toes with a slight knee bend
- Compression sleeve helps with the pressure feeling
- The lump isn't dangerous and doesn't mean you have to quit — just monitor it. If it suddenly pops and your whole calf swells up, that's a different situation — get help.

---

## Part 2: Ankle Stuff

### The Classic Rolled Ankle

You know this one. Foot hits a rock wrong, rolls outward, you feel something unpleasant, you're on the ground doing a little pain dance.

**First thing to figure out:** Can you stand on it and take a few steps? If yes — it's probably a sprain, not a fracture. If bearing any weight at all is impossible and the pain feels like it's in the bone itself, suspect something more serious.

**What to do right there on trail:**
- Sit down, pack off, breathe
- Get it in cold creek water or packed with ice
- Wrap it with a figure-8 ACE bandage or Leukotape — look up "figure-8 ankle taping" on YouTube *before* you need this, learn it now
- Get your poles out
- Mild, can walk okay: tape it, shorten the day, move carefully
- Moderate, feels sketchy: seriously consider camping right there and giving it a day
- Can't walk on it: you may need to call for help

---

### Inner Ankle Soreness — The Sneaky One

This one doesn't come from a specific wipeout. It just gradually shows up as you rack up miles — pain on the inside of your ankle, just above that inner bony knob. Feels like a light sprain even though nothing happened.

**What it feels like:** Dull ache on the inner ankle above the bony knob. Worse going downhill and on uneven ground. Stiff in the morning but loosens up after a bit of walking.

**What to do:**
- Leukotape wrapped around the inner ankle with foam underwrap underneath — the foam keeps the aggressive tape from tearing your skin off after a few days
- Ankle compression sleeve
- Pull back on mileage for a few days if it's actively sore
- Ice it after walking
- Check your insoles — if they're worn flat, they're not supporting anything anymore

> This one almost never becomes a serious problem if you catch it early. It's just your ankle saying "hey, a little support would be nice right now."

---

### If You Have Metal in Your Leg

If you've had surgery and there's a plate or screws in your leg, pay a little extra attention to that spot. The hardware itself is solid — that's not the worry. What you're watching for is pain specifically at that spot that keeps getting worse day after day, especially if it doesn't loosen up as you warm up.

Aching at a hardware site when it's cold or after a huge day is normal — that's just your body being aware of the metal. Escalating localized bone pain that doesn't improve? Get that looked at before continuing.

---

## Part 3: Shin Stuff

![Shin splints are the bread-and-butter overuse injury of the first few weeks on trail](https://myofitness.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Shin-Splints-1024x819.png)

### Classic Shin Splints

The bread and butter of "did too much too fast" injuries. It's basically your legs saying "bro, we are not ready for this mileage yet."

**What it feels like:** Achy soreness along the *inner* edge of your shin — the inside of the bone, not the front. Tender if you run your thumb along that inner edge. Often hurts more at the start of a walk, eases up in the middle, comes back when you're tired. Goes away with rest, comes back when you walk again.

**What to do:**
- Back off the miles — this one gets worse the more you grind through it
- Cold creek water on the shin after walking
- Ibuprofen
- Stretch your calves — tight calves make this worse
- Calf compression sleeve helps
- Use your poles

**The good news:** Most shin splints sort themselves out by weeks 3-4 as your legs adapt. Your body is just behind on the adjustment curve. Give it a chance to catch up instead of burying it in more miles.

---

### Stress Fracture — The Serious Version

This is what happens when you ignore shin splints for too long. The bone itself starts to crack. This is not the same as shin splints and you need to know the difference.

**How to tell them apart:** Shin splints hurt in a broad, spread-out way along the inner edge. Stress fracture hurts in one very specific spot — you can put the tip of one finger on exactly where it hurts. Shin splints ease up mid-walk. Stress fracture pain does not.

**The hop test:** Stand on the hurting leg. Hop once firmly. Sharp pain on landing = red flag.

> ⚠️ **If you think it might be a stress fracture — stop. Done. No more miles on that leg until you get it checked. A stress fracture that breaks all the way through in the backcountry means helicopter, not trail. Don't gamble on this one.**

---

### Front of Shin Ache

Different from shin splints — this is the muscle running down the *front* of your shin, the one that lifts your foot up with every step.

**What it feels like:** Tightness or aching down the front of your lower leg, sometimes into the top of your foot. Worse going uphill and on long descents.

**What to do:**
- Loosen the lower laces on your boot
- Stretch: kneel with the tops of your feet flat on the ground, sit back gently until you feel a stretch down the front of your shin
- Ease up on aggressive uphill sections for a day or two
- Massage the meaty muscle on the front of the shin — not the bone itself

---

### The Pressure Build-Up — Compartment Thing

Less common but worth knowing. Your lower leg muscles are wrapped in tight sheaths. When you push really hard for a long time, those muscles swell inside the sheath and pressure builds up.

**What it feels like:** Not just soreness — actual pressure, like something inflating inside your leg. Builds as you hike, forces you to slow or stop, then goes away within 20-30 minutes of rest, then comes back when you start again. Very consistent, very repeatable.

**What to do:** Rest is all you can do on trail. If it's happening every day and getting worse, get it evaluated at the next town.

---

### Outer Lower Leg Snapping — Peroneal Tendons

Two tendons run down the outer side of your lower leg and around the back of your outer ankle knob. All the uneven terrain on the PCT stresses these constantly.

**What it feels like:** Aching or snapping along the outer lower leg and behind the outer ankle. Sometimes it actually feels like something is popping in and out of place when you move your ankle.

**What to do:**
- Ankle sleeve or Leukotape targeting the outer ankle
- Poles to take some of the lateral balancing load off
- Avoid seriously off-camber terrain when it's irritated
- If the snapping is happening a lot, pay attention — that tendon flicking around can cause damage over time

---

## Your Basic Trail Kit for This Stuff

- **Trekking poles** — the most important thing on this whole list. Use them on every descent.
- **Knee sleeve** — get one with a kneecap cutout for front-of-knee issues; plain compression for everything else
- **Ankle sleeve** — one per ankle if you have history
- **ACE bandage** — versatile, handles ankle and knee wrapping, improvised compression anywhere
- **Leukotape + foam underwrap** — better than ACE for long-term ankle support, stays put even when sweaty
- **Ibuprofen** — don't overdo it in hot dry conditions; use it to knock down a bad flare, not as a daily habit
- **Electrolyte tabs** — cramps and tendon problems get worse when you're low on sodium, not just water
- **Cold creek water** — free, everywhere, works great. Soak what hurts.

---

## When Do You Actually Need to Get Off Trail?

If any of these are happening, the answer is not more miles:

- Can't put weight on a leg at all after a fall or twist
- Knee locks up and won't straighten
- Inside of the knee joint feels swollen and full — not just surface swelling, the actual inside
- Bone pain getting worse every single day and doesn't loosen up when you warm up
- Sharp pain on the one-leg hop test
- Red lines spreading away from a wound — infection spreading, needs antibiotics today
- Calf swollen, warm, and red after an ankle injury — possible blood clot, treat as emergency

---

## The Thing to Remember

The PCT is long. 2,650 miles long. There is no shortage of trail. The hikers who make it to Canada are not the ones who never got hurt — they're the ones who took the rest day when the body asked for it, taped it up correctly, and didn't let ego turn a three-day problem into a three-week one.

Take care of your body. It's the only piece of gear you can't replace at the next outfitter.

You got this, my dude. See you out there. 🤙

# Technical Reference

*Anatomical terms, clinical distinctions, and full detail for those who want it. Same injuries, same order — just with the full picture.*

---

## The Universal Principle

Almost every lower body injury on trail falls into one of two categories.

**Overuse injuries** build gradually from repetitive load — shin splints, tendinopathy, IT band syndrome, stress reactions. These give you warning signs. They respond to reduced mileage, rest, and smart management. Ignoring them converts a 3-day problem into a 3-week one.

**Acute injuries** happen suddenly — rolled ankles, ligament sprains, muscle tears. These require honest assessment of whether you can safely continue, and clear red flags that mean get off trail.

The skill is knowing which category you're in and acting accordingly. Toughness is not the same as good judgment.

---

## Part 1: Knee Injuries

### IT Band Syndrome — Lateral Knee

The iliotibial band is a thick strip of connective tissue running down the outside of the thigh and crossing the lateral knee. Under repeated load — especially on descents — it rubs against the bony prominence on the outside of the femur and inflames.

**Feels like:** Sharp or burning pain on the outside of the knee. Appears after a consistent number of miles — your personal "IT band threshold" — and tends to get worse the longer you push. Worse going downhill. Sometimes a clicking sensation. Rarely present going uphill.

**Most common cause:** Weak hip abductors causing the knee to track inward, combined with the repetitive descent stress of a thru-hike. The pain is at the knee but the problem is usually tightness and weakness higher up.

**Field treatment:**
- Trekking poles to reduce descent impact — the single most effective intervention
- Shorten stride going downhill; take smaller steps rather than big lunging ones
- Foam roll or massage the outer thigh from hip to knee — not just the knee itself
- Stretch: cross one leg behind the other and lean away from the affected side until you feel a pull down the outer thigh
- Rest, ice from a cold creek, ibuprofen
- Compression sleeve provides comfort but doesn't fix the underlying issue

**The honest timeline:** IT band syndrome often resolves as the body adapts around weeks 3-4 of a thru-hike, even without perfect treatment. But it won't resolve if you keep hammering big descent days while it's actively flaring.

---

### Patellofemoral Syndrome — Anterior Knee

The kneecap (patella) tracks in a groove on the end of the femur. Under sustained load, muscle imbalances, or heavy pack weight, it tracks poorly and grinds against the cartilage beneath.

**Feels like:** Dull aching under or around the kneecap. Worse going downstairs or downhill. Stiffness after sitting for a long time — the "theater sign," where standing up after a long rest is the worst moment. Sometimes a grinding sensation with movement.

**Most common cause:** Quad muscle imbalance, specifically weakness in the VMO (the teardrop-shaped muscle just above the inner kneecap that helps the patella track correctly), combined with the sustained descent stress of carrying a pack.

**Field treatment:**
- Trekking poles — the highest-value tool for any descent knee issue
- Knee sleeve with a patellar cutout is more effective than a plain compression sleeve; it helps guide the kneecap mechanically
- Shorten stride on descents, maintain a slight bend in the knee rather than locking it straight on impact
- Avoid deep squats when actively painful
- Ice and elevation at camp

---

### Medial Collateral Ligament Strain — Medial Knee

The MCL runs along the inside of the knee joint and stabilizes against lateral (valgus) forces. Uneven trail terrain, fatigue-induced instability, and missteps all stress it.

**Feels like:** Pain specifically on the inner side of the knee at the joint line. Sometimes described as a "pinching" sensation. Tender to touch on the medial knee. May feel mildly unstable on uneven ground, particularly when stepping sideways.

**Grades matter here:**
- **Grade 1** — tender, mild pain, stable joint. Manageable on trail with care.
- **Grade 2** — more significant pain, some instability, notable swelling. Reduced mileage required.
- **Grade 3** — complete tear, significant instability, can't trust the knee. Get off trail.

**Field treatment:**
- Compression sleeve provides meaningful stabilization
- Trekking poles to offload lateral stress
- Avoid terrain requiring big lateral steps or side-hilling while irritated
- Ice and elevation at camp
- Walk on flatter, more predictable terrain until it settles

---

### Meniscus Irritation — Deep Joint Line

The menisci are the cartilage cushions between the femur and tibia. They absorb impact and distribute load. Cumulative miles, heavy pack weight, and fatigue compress them repeatedly.

**Feels like:** Pain right at the joint line — the crease of the knee — rather than above or below it. Worse with twisting motions or deep knee flexion. Sometimes a locking or catching sensation where the knee momentarily won't fully extend. Can cause intra-articular swelling — the joint itself feels puffy and tight from the inside, not just surface edema.

**Field treatment:**
- Rest is the primary tool — the meniscus does not respond well to pushing through
- Avoid deep squats and any rotational movements
- Trekking poles
- Locking that won't release = get off trail and get it evaluated

> ⚠️ **Significant intra-articular swelling or a knee that locks and won't release = get off trail and get it evaluated.**

---

### Posterior Knee Pain

Pain behind the knee can originate from hamstring tendon insertion irritation, a Baker's cyst (popliteal bursitis — fluid accumulation in the popliteal fossa), or referred pain from intra-articular pathology.

**Feels like:** Aching or tightness directly behind the knee. Sometimes a feeling of fullness or pressure in the popliteal fossa. A distinct palpable lump that enlarges after activity indicates a Baker's cyst.

**Field treatment:**
- Rest and elevation — generally responds well
- Gentle hamstring stretching
- Compression sleeve helps manage the sensation of pressure
- Baker's cyst is not dangerous and doesn't require evacuation unless it ruptures (sudden sharp posterior knee pain followed by calf swelling — treat as possible DVT)

---

## Part 2: Ankle Injuries

### Lateral Ankle Sprain

The most common acute trail injury. The ankle inverts, overstretching the lateral ligament complex — primarily the ATFL (anterior talofibular ligament), sometimes the CFL (calcaneofibular ligament).

**Feels like:** Immediate lateral ankle pain post-inversion, rapid swelling over the lateral malleolus, point tenderness directly over the ATFL (just anterior and inferior to the lateral malleolus).

**The Ottawa Ankle Rules — field fracture screening:** Inability to bear weight for four steps immediately after injury AND point tenderness at the posterior edge or tip of either malleolus suggests possible fracture rather than sprain.

**Field treatment:**
- RICE: rest, ice (creek water), compression (figure-8 Leukotape or ACE), elevation
- Trekking poles immediately to offload
- Grade 1 (mild, stable, can ambulate): tape, shorten the day, continue carefully
- Grade 2 (moderate pain, some instability): consider a rest day before continuing
- Grade 3 (unable to bear weight, gross instability): may require assistance to evacuate

---

### Posterior Tibial Tendinopathy — Medial Ankle

Gradual-onset medial ankle pain just proximal to the medial malleolus, involving the posterior tibial tendon as it courses behind and below the medial malleolus. Load-bearing on every step makes this a high-priority injury to catch early.

**Feels like:** Dull aching on the medial ankle just superior to the medial malleolus. Worsens on descents and uneven terrain. Morning stiffness that resolves with activity. Often presents as a "sprained" sensation without any acute mechanism.

**Field treatment:**
- Leukotape applied over Cover-Roll pre-wrap to the medial ankle — posterior tibial tendon taping technique
- Ankle compression sleeve
- Reduce mileage 3-5 days if actively inflamed
- Worn or flat insoles significantly increase load on this tendon — assess and address
- Ice 15-20 minutes post-activity

---

### Surgical Hardware Considerations

Implanted hardware (plates, screws, intramedullary nails) creates stress risers at screw holes under sustained cyclic loading. The hardware itself is stable post-healing, but the surrounding bone may be relatively more vulnerable under thru-hike loads.

**Normal:** Aching at the hardware site with cold, elevation change, or post-high-mileage fatigue — periosteal and soft tissue sensitivity to temperature and load.

**Abnormal:** Localized point tenderness at the hardware site worsening day over day, particularly without a warm-up response. This pattern warrants cessation of hiking and imaging before resuming.

---

## Part 3: Shin Injuries

### Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome — Shin Splints

The most common overuse injury in the early weeks of a thru-hike, particularly when mileage ramps faster than the musculoskeletal system can adapt. Involves the tibialis posterior and soleus attachments along the posteromedial tibial cortex, causing periosteal inflammation.

**Feels like:** Diffuse aching along the posteromedial border of the tibia — the inner edge of the shinbone. Broad tenderness to palpation along the lower two-thirds. Eases with rest, returns with activity. Often worse at the start of a session, improves mid-walk, returns with fatigue.

**Field treatment:**
- Reduce mileage immediately — escalation while symptomatic worsens the condition
- Ice along the posteromedial tibia 15-20 minutes post-activity
- NSAIDs to interrupt the inflammatory cycle
- Gastrocnemius and soleus stretching — tight posterior chain increases tibial stress
- Calf compression sleeve
- Trekking poles to reduce impact loading

**Prognosis on trail:** MTSS that begins in weeks 1-2 often resolves by weeks 3-4 as osseous and soft tissue adaptation occurs — provided mileage is not escalated during the symptomatic period.

---

### Tibial Stress Fracture

The serious progression from undertreated MTSS, involving accumulating microdamage to the tibial cortex that can progress to complete fracture under continued loading.

**Feels like:** Point tenderness precisely localizable to a small area on the tibial shaft — not the diffuse tenderness of MTSS. Pain that does not resolve with warm-up. Possible nocturnal aching. Occasionally palpable periosteal thickening.

**The hop test:** Single-leg hop on the affected limb. Significant pain on impact is a sensitive field indicator for stress fracture.

**Key distinction from MTSS:** MTSS tenderness is diffuse and linear along the posteromedial border. Stress fracture tenderness is focal and precise. MTSS improves mid-activity. Stress fracture pain does not.

> ⚠️ **Suspected tibial stress fracture = cease hiking. Progression to complete fracture in the backcountry constitutes a medical emergency requiring evacuation. Non-negotiable.**

---

### Tibialis Anterior Tendinopathy — Anterior Shin

Involves the tibialis anterior muscle and its tendon, which runs down the anterior compartment of the lower leg and inserts on the medial cuneiform and first metatarsal base. Controls dorsiflexion and eccentric foot lowering during the gait cycle.

**Feels like:** Aching or tightness along the anterior lower leg, sometimes extending distally toward the dorsum of the foot. Worse with sustained uphill hiking and during eccentric loading on descents.

**Most common cause:** Excessive heel drop in footwear forcing the anterior compartment to work in a lengthened position, or rapid mileage increase before the tibialis anterior has adapted.

**Field treatment:**
- Reduce lace tension over the lower boot
- Stretch via plantar flexion with the dorsum of the foot flat on the ground — lengthens the tibialis anterior
- Temporarily reduce uphill grade and intensity
- Soft tissue massage to the muscle belly of the anterior compartment

---

### Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome

The lower leg musculature is enclosed within fascial compartments. During sustained high-intensity exercise, intracompartmental pressure rises as muscles hypertrophy and engorge with blood, exceeding the compliance of the fascial envelope.

**Feels like:** Progressive tightness, pressure, or cramping during activity — characteristically building to a threshold that forces the hiker to slow or stop. Resolves within 15-30 minutes of rest. Recurs predictably with resumption of activity. The consistency and reproducibility of the pattern is the clinical hallmark.

**Field treatment:** Activity modification is the only field option. Definitive treatment is surgical fasciotomy. Manageable on trail by controlling pace and recognizing personal threshold. Worsening pattern warrants evaluation at the next available medical facility.

---

### Peroneal Tendinopathy / Subluxation — Lateral Lower Leg

The peroneus longus and brevis tendons course posteriorly around the lateral malleolus, stabilizing the subtalar joint against inversion stress. The PCT's constant off-camber and uneven terrain creates repetitive stress on this system.

**Feels like:** Aching or snapping along the lateral lower leg and posterior to the lateral malleolus. In subluxation, a distinct popping sensation as the tendon displaces anteriorly over the lateral malleolus during ankle movement.

**Field treatment:**
- Lateral ankle compression sleeve or Leukotape targeting the peroneal groove
- Trekking poles to reduce the lateral stabilization demands on the peroneals
- Avoid highly cambered terrain when symptomatic
- Persistent subluxation warrants evaluation — repeated displacement can cause longitudinal tendon tears

---

## The Universal Lower Body Toolkit

**Trekking poles** — the highest single-value intervention for all descent-related lower extremity pathology. Redistribute 20-25% of impact load away from the lower limbs. With a heavy pack and any lower extremity history, they function as load management equipment, not optional accessories.

**Downhill technique** — shortened stride, maintained slight knee flexion on heel strike (avoid terminal knee extension), consideration of switchbacking on steep grades to reduce effective descent angle. The majority of lower extremity overuse injury accumulates on descents, not ascents.

**Compression** — reduces edema, improves proprioceptive feedback, maintains joint temperature. Minimum recommendation: one ankle sleeve, one knee sleeve.

**NSAIDs** — appropriate for acute inflammatory flares; disciplined use essential. Chronic daily NSAID use in a dehydration-prone environment (desert heat, high output) carries meaningful renal risk. Use for acute management, not chronic maintenance.

**Electrolytes** — electrolyte depletion (hyponatremia, hypokalemia) contributes to muscle cramping and may exacerbate tendon irritability. Consistent supplementation on high-output days is more effective than reactive dosing.

**Cold water immersion** — creek water immersion provides effective vasoconstriction and post-exercise recovery. 10-15 minutes of immersion is clinically meaningful.

**Elevation** — gravity-assisted reduction of dependent edema. Consistent practice at camp accelerates overnight recovery.

---

## Red Flags — Evacuation Indicated

- Non-weight-bearing after acute injury
- Locked knee that will not reduce
- Significant intra-articular effusion
- Progressive focal bone pain without warm-up response (stress fracture pattern)
- Positive hop test
- Wound with erythematous streaking (lymphangitis — systemic antibiotic indication)
- Post-ankle injury calf swelling with warmth and erythema (DVT — emergency)

---

## The Bottom Line

Most lower body injuries on the PCT are overuse injuries that announce themselves before they become serious. The hikers who finish aren't the ones who never get hurt — they're the ones who read the signals accurately, take 2-3 days when the body asks for it, and don't convert a grade 1 problem into a grade 3 one by refusing to back off.

Know the map. Listen to the signals. Make smart calls. The trail is 2,650 miles long — there's plenty of it left after a rest day.
