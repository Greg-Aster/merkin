# PCT Gear Readiness Check

With a March 13 start date coming up, I decided to run a readiness audit on my Pacific Crest Trail gear.

After laying everything out and weighing it, my base weight came in at **29–30 pounds** (no food or water).

That puts me in the “heavy but functional” category by modern thru-hiker standards.

Here’s what I’m carrying and why.

---

## Pack & Sleep System

- **Gregory Baltoro 75L** (used, excellent condition)  
- **Catoma Burrow bivy + rainfly**  
- Military sleep system intermediate bag  
- Surplus Therm-a-Rest self-inflating pad  
- Tyvek groundsheet  

The Baltoro is not ultralight. It has a reputation for reliability, and reviews online say that it can handle 40+ lbs with ease. Same story with the military sleep system -- warm, durable, bulky -- I am taking only the intermidate bag and leaving the patrol bag at home. I needed something for subzero temperatures, waterproof, durable and not expensive.

The Catoma + fly already provides bug and rain protection, is decently light and may have overlapping function with the MSS bivy.

## Footwear & Foot Care

- Columbia "Granite" high-top trail runners  
- Flojos sandals (camp shoes)  
- 3 pairs merino wool socks  
- Under Armour synthetic underwear  
- Leukotape  
- Squirrel’s Nut Butter anti-chafe  

I’ve debated boots because of pack weight and the Sierra snow, but I suspect the shoes will last till the base of the mountainous areas -- so lightweight breathable trail runners for the desert, buy better shoes when they wear out.

The anti-chafe and underwer is something rarely mentioned with hikers. Something that dries well, and doesn't smell is needed. Underwear recomendation came from marathon runners. Squirrel nut butter is coconut oil, beeswax, and vitamin E so it can be used as a lip balm or moisturizer.

## Clothing System

- 2 Columbia synthetic hiking shirts  
- 2 Columbia synthetic cargo pants  
- 1 light long-sleeve layer Parna
- Columbia 3L Titanium rain shell  
- Wrangler active thermal base layer bottom
- Parna waffle base layer long sleve shirt
- Atheltic undeshirt quicksilver
- Buff
- Beanie
- Sun hoodie found in a bargin bin
- Light "sun" gloves + medium gloves 

Clothing system is set so there is a base layer, light clothes, mid, top, and shell. Interchangable and stackable as needed. I am not brand loyal but you cant certainly tell I visited the Columbia Employee store and Costco with sprinkle of cheap bastard.

## Water & Food

- Sawyer Squeeze (with adapters)  
-  1L Smartwater bottles (planned but not purchased) 
- Rocket Stove knockoff 
- Stanley 1L stainless steel pot  
- Bear canister (plan to rent when required)  
- Hang bag + paracord + Ziplocs 
- Fuel canister and lighter (planned)

The stainless pot is heavier than titanium options, but it works and it’s tough.
The water system is standard PCT fare. Original plan was use alchol stove but I saw mixed reviews online regarding this and decided to switch. As of time writing this I do not have fuel, lighter because of travel concerns.

## Navigation & Power

- Smartphone (planning to use FarOut)  
- Anker battery bank  x2
- Anker dual-port wall charger  
- 2 waterproof headlamps with spare batteries  

I also own Cobra walkie-talkies, but after thinking it through, I will not be bringing them. They are rarely used on the PCT and offer limited range in mountainous terrain.

A satellite device is still something I’m considering.

## Tools, Hygiene & Repair

- Heavy-duty knife/spade  
- Leatherman Wave  
- Toothbrush + toothpaste  
- Dr. Bronner’s (small bottle)  
- Floss  
- Wet wipes  
- Smartwater bidet cap  
- Gorilla tape wrapped on trekking poles  
- Needle and thread  
- Zip ties  
- Patch kit  
- Costco trekking poles
- High altitude medication, Finesteride, Onterestrone, Ibuprophen 

Nothing fancy.

## The Numbers.

I weigh **215 pounds**.

With a 30-pound base weight, that’s about **14% of my body weight**.

Even fully loaded at 40–45 pounds with food and water, I’ll be under 20%.

This setup favors:

- Warm nights  
- Storm security  
- Durability  
- Lower gear failure risk

## Sierra Snow Question

Starting March 13 means I’ll likely reach the Sierra in mid-May.

Snow is probable.

That doesn’t automatically mean boots or full crampons. Most hikers use trail runners plus microspikes and adjust based on conditions at Kennedy Meadows.

I’ll evaluate snowpack closer to entry.

## Final Assessment

Am I ultralight? No.

Am I prepared? I'm sure likely to be missing something.

The biggest potential weight savings would come from:

- Lighter sleep system  
- Lighter pack  
- Lighter cook pot
