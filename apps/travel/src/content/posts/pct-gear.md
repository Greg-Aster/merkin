# PCT Gear Readiness Check

With a March 13 start date coming up, I ran a full readiness audit on my Pacific Crest Trail setup.

After laying everything out and weighing it, my base weight came in at **29–30 pounds** (no food or water).

That puts me in the “heavy but functional” category by modern thru-hiker standards.

Here’s what I’m carrying, why I chose it, and where I can cut weight.

## Photo Layout (temporary)

I’ll replace these with my own trail photos as soon as I shoot them. For now, I added temporary image slots so the post layout is ready.

## Pack & Sleep System

- **Gregory Baltoro 75L** (used, excellent condition)
- **Catoma Burrow bivy + rainfly**
- Military sleep system intermediate bag
- Surplus Therm-a-Rest self-inflating pad
- Tyvek groundsheet

The Baltoro is not ultralight, but it has a reputation for reliability and comfort under heavier loads.

Same story with the military sleep system: warm, durable, and bulky. I’m taking only the intermediate bag and leaving the patrol bag at home.

The Catoma + fly gives me bug and rain protection and may overlap slightly with the MSS bivy, but I value redundancy for weather early on.

## Footwear & Foot Care

- Columbia “Granite” high-top trail runners
- Flojos sandals (camp shoes)
- 3 pairs merino wool socks
- Under Armour synthetic underwear
- Leukotape
- Squirrel’s Nut Butter anti-chafe

I debated boots because of pack weight and expected Sierra conditions, but my current plan is breathable trail runners for the desert and a replacement/upgrade when needed.

The anti-chafe and underwear choices matter more than people admit. Fast-drying gear that stays comfortable helps prevent avoidable problems.

## Clothing System

- 2 Columbia synthetic hiking shirts
- 2 Columbia synthetic cargo pants
- 1 light long-sleeve layer (Prana)
- Columbia 3L Titanium rain shell
- Wrangler active thermal base layer bottom
- Prana waffle base layer long-sleeve shirt
- Athletic undershirt (Quiksilver)
- Buff
- Beanie
- Sun hoodie (bargain-bin find)
- Light sun gloves + medium gloves

The clothing system is built to layer cleanly: base, light hiking, insulation, and shell.

I’m not brand-loyal, but the setup is practical and affordable.

---

## Water & Food

- Sawyer Squeeze (with adapters)
- 2x 1L Smartwater bottles (planned, not yet purchased)
- Pocket rocket-style stove (knockoff)
- Stanley 1L stainless steel pot
- Bear canister (plan to rent when required)
- Hang bag + paracord + Ziplocs
- Fuel canister and lighter (planned)

The stainless pot is heavier than titanium options, but it’s durable and already owned.

I originally planned to use an alcohol stove, but after mixed reviews I switched to a canister stove. I still need to pick up fuel and a lighter due to travel constraints.

---

## Navigation & Power

- Smartphone (planning to use FarOut)
- 2x Anker battery banks
- Anker dual-port wall charger
- 2 waterproof headlamps with spare batteries

I also own Cobra walkie-talkies, but I’m leaving them behind. They’re uncommon on the PCT and have limited value in mountainous terrain.

A satellite device is still under consideration.

---

## Tools, Hygiene & Repair

- Heavy-duty knife/spade
- Leatherman Wave
- Toothbrush + toothpaste
- Dr. Bronner’s (small bottle)
- Floss
- Wet wipes
- Smartwater bidet cap
- Gorilla tape wrapped on trekking poles
- Needle and thread
- Zip ties
- Patch kit
- Costco trekking poles
- High-altitude medication, finasteride, ondansetron, ibuprofen

Nothing fancy, just enough to stay functional and repair what fails.

---

## The Numbers

I weigh **215 pounds**.

With a 30-pound base weight, that’s about **14% of body weight**.

Even fully loaded at 40–45 pounds with food and water, I’ll stay under 20%.

This setup favors:

- Warm nights
- Storm security
- Durability
- Lower gear failure risk

## Sierra Snow Question

Starting March 13 means I’ll likely reach the Sierra in mid-May.

Snow is probable.

That doesn’t automatically mean boots or full crampons. Many hikers go with trail runners plus microspikes, then adjust at Kennedy Meadows based on current conditions.

I’ll evaluate snowpack and gear additions closer to entry.

## Final Assessment

Am I ultralight? No.

Am I prepared? Mostly — but I’m sure I’ll discover gaps once I’m out there.

Biggest potential weight savings:

- Lighter sleep system
- Lighter pack
- Lighter cook pot

The goal is simple: start with a setup I trust, then refine as trail reality gives better data.
