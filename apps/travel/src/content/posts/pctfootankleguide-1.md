**Early Warning Signs · Field Treatment · Shoe Strategy**

*Pacific Crest Trail 2026 | Campo to Canada*

---

Your feet are your engine. Everything else on this trail is replaceable — your feet are not. This guide compiles research, real experience, and hard-won lessons into a practical field reference. It covers the early warning signs you must recognize, how to treat problems before they become trail-enders, and how to make smart shoe decisions from the desert start to the Sierra.

## Part 1: Reading Your Feet

The single most important skill on a long-distance hike is knowing the difference between discomfort that means "your body is adapting" and pain that means "stop now." Getting this wrong in either direction costs you: ignore real signals and you're injured; panic at normal soreness and you never build the toughness you need.

### Good Sore vs. Bad Sore

**Good sore** is generalized fatigue — the bottoms of your feet feel tired, maybe a dull ache through the arch or ball of the foot, similar to how your legs feel after a hard workout. It resolves with rest, usually overnight or within a day. This is your feet adapting, building tougher skin, and strengthening connective tissue.

**Bad sore** is anything sharp, localized, or persistent. Specifically watch for:

- Sharp pain in the heel (plantar fasciitis territory)
- Pain on top of the foot in a specific metatarsal (stress fracture warning)
- Burning or stinging in a specific spot (blister forming or nerve irritation)
- Numbness or tingling (nerve compression, often from tight shoes)
- Pain that gets worse as you walk rather than loosening up after the first mile

> **The "worse as you go" distinction matters most.** Good sore eases once you're warmed up. Bad sore escalates.

---

## Part 2: Blisters

### The Hot Spot Doctrine

A blister that has formed is a problem. A hot spot — the warm, slightly reddened patch before a blister forms — is just information. Your only job when you feel a hot spot is to stop immediately, address it, and move on. Thirty seconds of prevention saves days of recovery.

![Leukotape applied to a heel — the most important blister tool you can carry](https://sectionhiker.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Leukotape-P-The-Ultimate-Blister-Prevention-Tape-1200x800.jpg)

### Early Warning Signs

- Warmth or burning in one specific location
- A red patch on the skin before any fluid has formed
- Tingling or friction-like sensation with each step

### Field Treatment Protocol

- Stop when you first feel the hot spot — not at the next mile marker
- Remove boot and sock, dry the foot thoroughly
- Apply Leukotape or moleskin directly over the hot spot
- If a blister has already formed: drain with a sterile needle, leave the roof intact, tape securely
- Do not pop and leave open — the roof is your bandage

### Prevention

- Keep toenails trimmed short and straight across — most black toenails are a nail-length problem
- Use quality socks (Darn Tough or similar merino wool)
- Change socks mid-day in desert heat to reduce moisture
- Apply Leukotape proactively to known problem areas before your day starts
- Check shoe fit regularly — swollen trail feet need looser lacing

---

## Part 3: Tendon & Overuse Injuries

### Top-of-Foot / Extensor Tendon Pain

The extensor tendons run across the top of the foot and connect into the front of the ankle. They work constantly on trail because your foot is dorsiflexing with every step, especially on uneven terrain where your foot makes micro-adjustments. This is one of the most common overuse issues for hikers ramping up mileage.

**Early warning signs:**
- Soreness or tightness where the top of the foot meets the ankle
- Pain that worsens with uphill sections
- Tenderness directly under the boot tongue

**Most common causes:**
- Lacing too tight across the top of the foot — pressure on the tendons under the tongue
- Deconditioned extensors that fatigue faster than the rest of the foot
- High shoe drop or stiff soles forcing the tendons to work harder

**Field treatment:**
- Loosen laces — especially the top eyelets
- Try "lace skipping" — skip the eyelet directly over the painful spot
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen) for a few days if no contraindications
- Elevate at camp
- Stretch calves gently — tight calves increase load on extensors

> ⚠️ **Ignoring extensor tendon pain that isn't warming up = 1-2 weeks off trail. Catch it early.**

---

### Medial Ankle / Posterior Tibial Tendon

Pain on the inside of the ankle, a few centimeters above the ankle bone, often feels like a "sprained" sensation even without a specific injury event. This location points to the posterior tibial tendon or the deltoid ligament complex — both are load-bearing on every single step.

![Medial ankle anatomy — understanding where the pain lives helps you respond correctly](https://www.birminghamorthopaedic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ankle-anatomy.jpg)

**Early warning signs:**
- Dull aching on the inner ankle just above the medial malleolus
- Pain that worsens going downhill or on uneven terrain
- Morning stiffness that eases after the first mile

**Field treatment & prevention:**
- Leukotape applied with pre-wrap (Cover-Roll) to the medial ankle — search "posterior tibial tendon taping" for technique
- Ankle compression sleeve targeting the malleolus area
- Reduce mileage for 3-5 days if actively flaring
- Ice 15-20 minutes after walking
- Check insoles — flat or worn insoles increase load on this tendon significantly

> Posterior tibial tendon issues caught early almost never become trail-enders. The key is not ignoring the first signals.

---

### Achilles Tendinopathy

The Achilles takes enormous load on a thru-hike, especially during big mileage days and ascents. Mid-tendon pain (2-6 cm above the heel) is the most common presentation for hikers.

**Early warning signs:**
- Morning stiffness that takes a mile or more to loosen up
- Tenderness to touch along the tendon
- Pain that "warms up" in the first hour but returns at end of day

**Red flags — seek help:**
- Sudden sharp pain like a "kick" from behind — possible rupture
- Swelling and warmth combined with resting pain
- Pain getting worse day over day rather than plateauing

---

## Part 4: Stress Reactions & Fractures

Stress fractures are the injury most likely to genuinely end a thru-hike if missed. They develop gradually from repetitive loading and are often mistaken for tendon soreness until they become serious.

**Early warning signs:**
- Very specific, pinpoint pain — you can put one finger on the exact spot
- Pain increases with impact, not with warmth
- Swelling on the top of the foot
- Does NOT warm up with activity — stays painful or worsens

> ⚠️ **If pain does not ease after the first 20 minutes of walking and is getting worse day over day — stop hiking. This is the stress fracture pattern.**

### A Note on Surgical Hardware

If you have a plate or screws from a previous fracture, those areas deserve extra attention. Stress risers can occur at screw holes under heavy repetitive loading. Aching at hardware sites from cold or elevation changes is normal; escalating localized pain at the hardware site is not. If in doubt, get it imaged before continuing.

---

## Part 5: Footwear Strategy

### The Reality: Trail Runners vs. Boots

More than 80% of PCT thru-hikers use trail runners, not boots. This isn't a trend — it reflects real advantages over thousands of miles. That said, the right shoe is the one that fits *your* feet, not the one that's most popular on forums.

**Trail runners — advantages:**
- Lighter = less fatigue over 20+ mile days (each pound on feet ≈ 5 lbs of perceived effort)
- Dry faster — critical in the desert and at water crossings
- Lower blister formation rate
- Usually no painful break-in period
- Better proprioception on technical terrain

**Trail runners — downsides:**
- 300-500 mile lifespan — plan on 5-6 pairs for a full thru-hike
- Less ankle structure for heavy pack loads
- Poor snow kicking performance in the Sierra

**Mid boots — when they make sense:**
- Heavy early-season Sierra snow requiring significant step-kicking
- Known ankle instability that trail runners can't manage
- You're coming from a hiking boot background and switching to something unfamiliar mid-hike is riskier than starting what you know

---

### The Waterproof Trap

**Do not buy waterproof or Gore-Tex trail runners for the PCT.** This is one of the most common and costly mistakes new thru-hikers make, and it feels completely counterintuitive.

Here's why waterproof is bad:

- **Water gets in anyway.** The PCT has river crossings, wet grass, morning dew, rain. Once water breaches the ankle collar — which it will — it cannot get out. You are now hiking in a sealed wet boot.
- **They don't breathe.** Your feet sweat. A lot. On a 20-mile day in the desert, your feet are generating heat and moisture constantly. Gore-Tex traps that moisture inside, creating a warm wet environment that is a blister and fungal factory.
- **They dry extremely slowly.** A standard mesh trail runner dries overnight. A waterproof version can take days. On a thru-hike, "days" means you're hiking in wet shoes.

The correct approach: **embrace getting wet, and prioritize fast drying.** Mesh uppers, drain holes, and breathable materials are your friends. Your feet will get wet. The goal is for them to get dry again fast.

---

### Sizing Up: The Half-to-Full-Size Rule

**Buy shoes a half to full size larger than your normal street shoe size.** This is non-negotiable on a thru-hike and here's why:

- Your feet swell with sustained daily mileage — often a full size or more over months of hiking
- Downhill sections push your foot forward into the toe box; cramped toes = black toenails and blisters
- Swollen feet in a correctly-sized shoe become painful feet in a too-small shoe

**The ideal fit at the shoe store:**
- Locked heel — no slip when you walk
- Snug midfoot — the arch area should feel supported, not loose
- Roomy toe box — you should be able to wiggle all toes freely, and there should be a thumb's width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe
- Test on an incline if possible — simulate downhill by pressing your foot forward; toes should not jam the front

---

### How to Actually Select a Shoe

The problem with "get Altra Lone Peaks" advice is that shoe models change every year, and a redesign can completely alter fit and feel. The Altra Lone Peak narrowed its toe box in recent versions to the frustration of many longtime fans. The shoe you read about in a 2022 blog post may be a different shoe in 2026.

![What matters: mesh uppers, wide toe box, grippy outsole — not the brand name](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Kp8cY4XQL._AC_UX695_.jpg)

**What to look for in any model, regardless of brand:**

- **Wide toe box** — allows foot splay under load, reduces blisters and nerve compression
- **Mesh upper** — breathability and fast drying; avoid leather-heavy uppers for desert sections
- **Vibram outsole or equivalent** — durable rubber with multi-directional lugs; Vibram Megagrip is a reliable benchmark
- **Rock plate** — optional but helpful for rocky sections; reduces foot fatigue on technical terrain
- **Gaiter attachment points** — worth having; trail gaiters keep desert sand out and dramatically reduce hot spots
- **Zero or low drop** — personal preference, but transition gradually from conventional shoes; sudden switch strains Achilles and calves

**Current models with strong PCT track records (2025-2026):**

- **Hoka Speedgoat** — durable Vibram outsole, good cushion, bolstered heel collar; runs narrow so try wide sizing
- **Topo Terraventure / Traverse** — wide toe box, Vibram Megagrip, rock plate; Traverse reportedly lasted 650+ miles for some hikers
- **Altra Experience Wild** — wide toe box, zero drop, Vibram outsole in "+" version; 2026 updates improved heel structure
- **Hoka Challenger** — maximalist cushion (42mm stack), breathable mesh; excellent for high-mileage days
- **Saucony Peregrine 16** — new Vibram Megagrip outsole in 2026; good for narrower feet who want toe room
- **Brooks Cascadia** — longtime thru-hiker staple, rock plate, gaiter attachment; available in wide

> **Important:** When a manufacturer changes your favorite shoe, it is no longer your favorite shoe. Always try on the current model before buying.

### The Mailing / Resupply Strategy

**Do not pre-buy all your shoes and mail them ahead before you start.** Your feet will change on trail — they toughen, swell, and shift over the first few hundred miles. The shoe that fits perfectly at home may not be what you want at mile 400.

**What actually works:**
- Start with one well-fitted pair broken in for at least 50 training miles
- When that pair approaches 400 miles, assess on trail — you'll know when they're dying
- Order the next pair to a town resupply stop ahead, or buy at trail town outfitters

**Trail towns with reliable shoe resupply:**
- Big Bear Lake (~265 miles)
- Wrightwood (~370 miles)
- Agua Dulce (~454 miles)
- Mammoth Lakes (~906 miles)
- South Lake Tahoe (~1090 miles)

For mail drops: address to yourself c/o General Delivery at the post office, or a hostel that accepts hiker packages. Allow at least 7-10 days lead time.

---

### Desert Start Strategy (Campo to Warner Springs)

Section A is dry, sandy, and hot by mid-morning. Trail runners are the right call here. Start conservative — 10-15 mile days for the first 10-14 days. Tape proactively. Sand gets into everything — trail gaiters are highly recommended from day one.

### Transition Strategy

Most hikers' first pair dies around Big Bear / Wrightwood (~400 miles). By Kennedy Meadows (~700 miles), evaluate snow on the ground. Most years, trail runners with microspikes handle the Sierra fine.

![The Sierra Nevada — where snow conditions drive footwear decisions](https://halfwayanywhere.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/PCT-Sierra-Nevada-Section.jpg)

> Most hikers do NOT wear boots for the entire trail. Trail runners by default — switch temporarily only if conditions demand it.

## Part 6: Ankle & Calf Pain Location Guide

### Ankle Pain by Location

**Lateral (outer) ankle:**
- Lateral ankle sprain — most common rolled ankle, involves ATFL/CFL ligaments
- Peroneal tendinopathy — outer ankle overuse, worsens on uneven terrain
- Fibula stress fracture — dull aching that increases with activity

**Medial (inner) ankle:**
- Posterior tibial tendinopathy — overuse, inner ankle/arch, worse on hills
- Deltoid ligament sprain — less common, requires significant force
- Tarsal tunnel syndrome — nerve compression causing burning/tingling

**Front of ankle:**
- Anterior ankle impingement — pinching pain with dorsiflexion (going uphill)
- Extensor tendinopathy — top of foot/ankle, often from tight lacing

**Behind/below ankle:**
- Achilles tendinopathy — stiffness and pain at or above the heel
- Retrocalcaneal bursitis — swelling right where tendon meets heel bone
- Achilles rupture — sudden severe pain, emergency

### Calf Pain by Type

**Muscle-related:**
- Gastrocnemius strain — upper/middle calf, sudden sharp pain during effort
- Soleus strain — deeper, lower calf, common in endurance hikers
- DOMS — diffuse soreness 24-72 hours after big effort, normal adaptation

**Serious — don't ignore:**
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — persistent swelling, warmth, redness; requires urgent care
- Chronic exertional compartment syndrome — tight pressure during activity that resolves with rest
- Referred pain from lumbar spine — L4/L5/S1 issues can mimic calf pain

## Quick Reference: Decision Matrix

| Condition | Footwear | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Desert — dry, hot | Trail runners | What 80%+ of thru-hikers wear |
| Mild snow (ankle depth) | Trail runners + microspikes | Most of Section A in March |
| Heavy early Sierra snow | Mid boots temporarily | Evaluate at Kennedy Meadows |
| Ankle instability flare-up | Temporary boot phase + Leukotape | Then return to runners |
| Top-of-foot tendon pain | Loosen laces, lighter shoe | Address immediately |
| Blister hot spot forming | Stop, tape, adjust sock | 30 seconds now = days saved later |

## Part 7: Real-World Application — A Case Study in Pre-Hike Foot Prep

*The following is a first-person account of the 8-week training period leading up to a March 10, 2026 PCT start at Campo. It's included here because theory is one thing — watching it play out in a real body on real terrain is another.*

---

### The Setup

I'm 6'1", 200-220 lbs, with a history of ankle surgery and prior fibula fracture with hardware still in place. Not an ultralight hiker. My starting pack weight is around 44 lbs — well above the thru-hiker average of 25-30 lbs. I started training 8 weeks out from my start date, which is on the shorter end of what most people recommend.

The relevant factors going in:
- Surgical hardware in the lower leg from a prior fibula fracture
- Prior ankle instability requiring surgery
- Higher-than-average pack weight amplifying load on every joint
- No serious hiking in the period immediately before training began

These aren't reasons not to hike. They're reasons to pay closer attention than the average person and to make decisions that account for a body that has some mileage on it.

---

### Week 1-2: Starting at 5 Miles

The first walks were 5 miles. Feet were sore in a general, diffuse way — the expected "my body is not used to this" soreness across the balls of both feet and some fatigue through the arch. That's the good kind of sore. Nothing sharp, nothing localized, nothing that didn't resolve overnight.

**What I learned:** 5 miles is a legitimate starting point even if it feels modest. The goal in week 1 isn't fitness — it's just introducing your feet to sustained load and seeing what comes up. The body will tell you things in training that it won't tell you until mile 200 if you skip this phase.

---

### Ramping Up to 10-16 Miles

As mileage increased, the first real issue appeared: **blisters**. The initial response was band-aids, which helped in the short term — but they move around, bunch up, and fall off with sweat.

The lesson blisters were teaching: once skin starts to blister in a particular spot, that spot is telling you something. Too much friction there. Possibly a sock issue, a lacing issue, a shoe that doesn't fit perfectly under load.

**What actually works better than band-aids:** Leukotape applied directly over the blister-prone area before the walk starts. It stays put, doesn't bunch, handles sweat. The goal is to stop treating blisters and start preventing them. Tape the hot spot before it becomes a blister. If it's already a blister, drain it, leave the roof on, tape over it.

---

### The Shoe Situation: What I Actually Bought and Why

The shoes I landed on were not the ones the internet would have recommended. They were the ones that were available, affordable, and fit reasonably well — which is honestly closer to how most real thru-hikers make gear decisions than the "best-in-class" guides suggest.

**Columbia Granite Trail Runners** — breathe well, dry reasonably fast, a legitimate trail shoe. Not a top-tier thru-hiker pick but a functional one, especially in desert conditions. These will handle Section A without issue.

**Oboz High Tops** — purchased as the Sierra and snow-condition shoe. Higher ankle collar offers containment for a previously operated ankle. Heavier and slower to dry than trail runners, but for a hiker with hardware in the fibula, documented ankle instability, and a 44 lb pack — more ankle support is a reasonable trade-off. Most people don't need high tops. I might.

**The important things both shoes got right:**
- Mesh uppers — breathable and fast-drying; no Gore-Tex
- Not waterproof — this matters enormously and is counterintuitive to most people
- Reasonably wide toe box for foot swell
- Broken in before the trail started

**What I'd tell someone else in this situation:** The ideal shoe on paper is not always the right shoe for your specific body. If you have hardware in your leg, prior ankle surgery, and a heavy pack, the "ultralight trail runner" gospel doesn't fully apply to you.

---

### The Ankle Incident

During training, real ankle pain developed on the medial side — inner ankle, a few centimeters above the medial malleolus. Not from a specific rolled-ankle event. Just gradually showed up as mileage increased.

The instinct to push through it was there. Two weeks from the start of a trip you've been planning for months, the last thing you want to do is back off. But I took a few easy days, iced it, and the pain improved significantly before the trail started.

**This is exactly the right call.** The math: 3-4 easy days before the trail versus 2-3 weeks off trail at mile 50 because an ignored tendon problem escalated. The trail will still be there. The trail is 2,650 miles long. A few easy days in training is not a setback — it's the move.

---

### The Pack Weight Reality

At 44 lbs to start, every foot and ankle issue is amplified. Pack weight is not just a comfort issue — it's a biomechanical one. More weight means more load per step, which means more cumulative stress on tendons, joints, and bones over the course of a day, a week, and five months.

For a hiker with prior ankle surgery and hardware in the lower leg, this matters more than it would for someone starting clean. The plan:

- Be conservative with daily mileage in the first two weeks (10-15 miles, not 20+)
- Watch the medial ankle closely under load
- Prioritize shoes that offer structure rather than the lightest possible option
- Consider lightening the pack at the first resupply

The first 110 miles to Warner Springs will tell you a lot. Your body will give you data in that stretch that no amount of pre-hike planning can predict.

---

### The Hardware Site

The old fibula fracture with plate and screws still in place is worth flagging. The hardware itself is stable — that's not the concern. The concerns are:

- **Stress risers at screw holes** — bone can be more vulnerable at points where screws have passed through under sustained heavy load
- **Soft tissue inflammation** — surrounding tissue can flare with high mileage even when hardware is solid
- **Cold sensitivity** — hardware sites often ache in cold or at elevation; this is normal and not a red flag

What to watch for: localized pain at the hardware site getting worse day over day, especially if it doesn't warm up with activity. That pattern warrants stopping and getting assessed. Normal aching from cold or fatigue is a nuisance, not an emergency.

---

### The Takeaway

None of the issues that came up in training were trail-enders. Blisters happened and were managed. Ankle pain developed and was addressed by backing off. Shoes were chosen based on real-world factors, not ideal-scenario advice.

That's what training is for — not just to build fitness, but to surface problems in a low-stakes environment where you have time to solve them. Every hot spot, every tendon twinge, every aching hardware site in training is information you want to have before Campo, not at mile 200.

**The core lesson:** Your body will communicate clearly if you're willing to listen. The skill isn't toughness — it's reading the signals accurately and responding with the right amount of urgency. Not panic, not denial. Just honest assessment and smart decisions.

---

## The Golden Rules

1. Stop at the first hot spot. Not at the next mile marker. **Now.**
2. Reduce mileage at the first sign of tendon pain. The trail will still be there.
3. Don't "push through" foot pain. Pain is data. Read it.
4. Replace shoes before they are dead — not after.
5. Dry your feet every single day. Trench foot is real and preventable.
6. Good sore warms up. Bad sore escalates. Know the difference.
7. Taping takes 30 seconds. A trail-ending blister takes 5-10 days. Do the math.
