# PCT Food Strategy: Front-Loading Calories to Skip Expensive Towns

Starting at Campo. Got a plan.

The first couple stops are small and notoriously expensive. I'd rather carry a heavier pack than hand over my wallet for a bag of trail mix in a parking lot. So I'm front-loading and pushing straight through to Julian, about 77 miles in.

This is mostly notes for myself.

---

## The Plan: 7 Days, ~4,500 Calories Per Day

Target: **~31,500 calories for the first stretch**

I walk fast. Expecting 5-6 days to Julian. Carrying 7 days worth anyway because I also thought I'd have abs by now, so clearly I overestimate things.

If I'm close to town on day 6 I can skip a meal or two and just eat when I get there.

---

## Base Philosophy

- Hard calories, packed heavy up front
- Skip the early town resupply
- Forage for micronutrients when possible
- Eat in towns for morale and sanity

Adjust as needed. This isn't a religion.

---

## What I'm Carrying (First 7 Days)

### Carbohydrate Base

- ~5 lb steel-cut oats
- ~11 ramen packets
- Chia seeds

Oats are cheap. Ramen has sodium. Chia seeds can be prepped cold and punch above their weight nutritionally.

---

### Fats (High Calorie Density)

- Olive oil
- Coconut oil (doubles as anti-chafe and skin stuff)

Oil is the best calorie-per-ounce deal you can get. Coconut oil earns its carry weight twice over.

---

### Nuts & Seeds

- Walnuts
- Pumpkin seeds

Snacks. That's it.

---

### Dried Fruit

- Mango
- Prunes

Not afraid of fiber, bro. No scurvy either.

---

### Protein & Salt

- Summer sausage

---

## Estimated Starting Pack Weight (Worst Case)

Base pack: ~30 lb  
Food: ~15-16 lb  
Water (4 L): ~9 lb

Total starting weight: **~54-55 lb**

Water weight is annoying but non-negotiable for me specifically. I'm still recovering from a deep bone infection in the jaw and staying hydrated helps keep that in check. I've also got a diagnosed heart arrhythmia that gets worse when I'm dehydrated. And I just sweat a lot. Like, a lot a lot. Starting in early spring so hopefully more water sources are available and I'm not hauling all 4L the whole time.

---

## Why Skip the First Towns?

- Lake Morena (~20 miles): limited, expensive
- Mount Laguna (~41 miles): better, still small

Julian at ~77 miles is an actual grocery stop. That's the target.

---

## Foraging (Bonus, Not a Plan)

Not trying to live off the desert. But I'll grab what I can:

- Prickly pear
- Yucca flowers if they're out
- Chia sage
- Mesquite pods
- Wild greens after rain

It's not a calorie strategy. It's something to do and a few free micronutrients.

---

## Concerns

- Am I carrying too much?
- Will I actually want 4,500 calories a day or will I be too tired to eat?

---

## Final Thought

Better to carry too much and ditch food than show up underfed and broke at mile 30. Early miles will be the hardest on the body as it adjusts. Carry the weight now, trim later.

First real stop is Julian.
