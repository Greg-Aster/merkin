      "title": "Diagnosis: Cosmic Knowledge Overdose",
      "description": "You have absorbed so much knowledge about the MegaMeal universe that your brain has achieved a dangerous level of cosmic awareness. You know things that mortal minds weren't meant to comprehend, and you've started correcting the universe's own documentation. Reality has filed several noise complaints about your excessive understanding."

      "title": "Diagnosis: Selective Reality Filtering",
      "description": "You have successfully avoided learning anything meaningful about the cosmic horror that surrounds you, which is actually the healthiest possible response. Your ignorance is so pure and complete that existential dread can't find you. You are the only truly sane person in the MegaMeal universe, which makes you completely insane by local standards."

      "title": "Diagnosis: Partial Knowledge Syndrome",
      "description": "You know just enough about the MegaMeal universe to be deeply concerned, but not enough to achieve the blissful madness of complete understanding. You exist in a perpetual state of cosmic confusion, which is both the most dangerous and most relatable condition possible. You are doomed to forever ask questions you don't want answered."

      "title": "Diagnosis: Inconclusive Cosmic Status",
      "description": "Your knowledge of the MegaMeal universe defies categorization. You simultaneously know everything and nothing, understand completely while being utterly baffled. You have achieved a quantum state of comprehension that exists in superposition until observed. Even we're not sure what's wrong with you."
