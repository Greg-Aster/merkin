You once sent a strongly worded letter to Einstein about his 'obviously flawed' theory of relativity, and you're pretty sure you could do a better job running the universe if someone would just give you the chance. Gravity itself rolls its eyes when you walk by."

You spent last week resenting quarks for their strong nuclear force, and you've been bitter about not being a gas giant since childhood. Even your own shadow gets more attention than you do, which makes you hate it."

You've been buying stars in bulk and hoarding gravity because you heard it might be valuable someday. Your net worth is calculated in entire solar systems, but you're still not satisfied because someone else owns all the dark matter. You make dragons look generous."

      "title": "Diagnosis: Galactic Ego Expansion Syndrome",
      "description": "Your sense of self-importance has grown so large that it now has its own gravitational field. You believe your opinions are so valuable that you've started charging admission for people to hear your thoughts. You once tried to patent your own existence and sent a cease-and-desist letter to everyone else in the universe for copyright infringement of being alive."
    },
    "OUTCOME_SLOTH": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Motivational Entropy Overdose",
      "description": "You have achieved such a profound state of inertia that you make black holes look energetic. You've been sitting in the same chair for so long that you've become geologically significant. Your laziness is so complete that you've trained your thoughts to think themselves, and you're too lazy to blink so you've hired someone to do it for you."

    "OUTCOME_WRATH": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Universal Rage Amplification Disorder",
      "description": "Your anger has reached such cosmic proportions that it's been classified as a new form of dark energy. You once got so mad at a star that it went supernova just to escape your fury. Your temper tantrums have been known to alter the rotation of nearby planets, and you're personally responsible for at least three minor ice ages. Even hurricanes are afraid of your mood swings."

    "OUTCOME_DENIAL": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Reality Rejection Syndrome",
      "description": "You refuse to acknowledge that existence exists and have convinced yourself that consciousness is just a myth perpetuated by the awake. You believe that the universe is actually just an elaborate practical joke being played on you by interdimensional entities with too much time on their hands. You've been living in denial for so long that denial has started charging you rent."

    "OUTCOME_NIHILISM": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Meaninglessness Amplification Disorder",
      "description": "You have embraced the void so completely that the void has started sending you Christmas cards. You believe that nothing matters so much that your nothing matters more than everyone else's nothing. You've written a 800-page manifesto on the importance of unimportance, which defeats the purpose, but you're too nihilistic to care about the contradiction."

      "title": "Diagnosis: Cosmic Self-Punishment Compulsion",
      "description": "You derive pleasure from the inevitable heat death of the universe and have started a collection of painful existential truths.

    "OUTCOME_SADISM": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Universal Cruelty Enhancement Syndrome",
      "description": "You enjoy watching stars die so much that you've started a subscription service to witness supernovas in real-time. You take pleasure in the fact that everything beautiful is temporary, and you've been known to laugh maniacally during documentaries about entropy. Even cosmic horror is disturbed by your level of enthusiasm for universal suffering."

      "title": "Diagnosis: Emotional Hoarding Disorder",
      "description": "You are so emotionally attached to every moment that you refuse to let time pass. You've been trying to preserve yesterday in formaldehyde and have started a museum of expired feelings.

      "title": "Diagnosis: Emotional Void Syndrome",
      "description": "You have become so detached from reality that reality has started leaving you passive-aggressive notes asking if you're still interested in participating.

You make sociopaths seem emotionally expressive."
    },
    "OUTCOME_CONTROL": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Universal Micromanagement Disorder",
      "description": "You believe you need to personally supervise every quantum interaction in the universe to make sure particles are behaving properly. You've been sending strongly worded emails to the laws of physics about their inconsistent enforcement, and you once tried to reorganize the periodic table alphabetically. Your need for control is so intense that chaos theory was invented specifically to annoy you."
    },
    "OUTCOME_CHAOS": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Entropy Acceleration Syndrome",
      "description": "You actively work to increase disorder in the universe because you find organization aesthetically offensive. Your presence causes spontaneous randomization of nearby matter, and you've been banned from several libraries for reorganizing books into chaotic piles. You believe that entropy isn't happening fast enough, so you've appointed yourself as its personal assistant."

    "OUTCOME_ISOLATION": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Voluntary Hermit Syndrome",
      "description": "You have withdrawn from society so completely that society occasionally forgets you exist and has to be reminded to include you in census data. You communicate exclusively through interpretive dance performed for an audience of houseplants, and you've trained pigeons to deliver your grocery list because human interaction is too overwhelming. You make antisocial personality disorder look gregarious."
    },
    "OUTCOME_CODEPENDENCY": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Universal Approval Addiction",
      "description": "You need constant validation from every conscious entity in the universe, including your own thoughts. You've been asking strangers for permission to breathe, and you won't make any decisions without consulting a focus group of at least 47 people.

      "title": "Diagnosis: Individuality Suppression Syndrome",
      "description": "You have molded yourself so perfectly to fit societal expectations that you've essentially become a human-shaped hole in reality.

      "title": "Diagnosis: Temporal Acceleration Disorder",
      "description": "You are so impatient that you've been trying to speed up the expansion of the universe by pushing against spacetime with your bare hands.

    },
    "OUTCOME_INDIFFERENCE": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Universal Disinterest Syndrome",
      "description": "You find everything so boring that boredom itself has become bored with you.

    "OUTCOME_JEALOUSY": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Comparative Suffering Disorder",
      "description": "You are jealous of everyone for everything, including their problems, which makes you jealous of your own jealousy.

    "OUTCOME_SHAME": {
      "title": "Diagnosis: Existential Embarrassment Disorder",
      "description": "You are so ashamed of existing that you've been trying to apologize to the universe for taking up space.
