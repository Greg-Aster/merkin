This primer serves as your non-linear menu to a multiverse where food is both weapon and religion, extinction events are just 'bad Yelp reviews,' and a fedora-clad figure haunts every timeline. Bon appétit, chrononaut. Pair your apocalyptic capitalism with notes of temporal paradox (vintage 28042), a bold extinction finish, and unsettling hints of 'The Snuggloids Are Watching.' Today's special? The Ouroboros Platter—you'll literally eat yourself. Reserve your table before heat death!"

# MEGAMEAL: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL FOOD ODYSSEY

Welcome to MEGAMEAL, a science fiction food parody universe where cosmic horror and hyper-capitalism collide on your plate.

## WHAT IS MEGAMEAL?

MEGAMEAL is an experimental mixed-media science fiction series that explores a dystopian future through the lens of food and culinary culture. Part cosmic horror, part satirical commentary, the story unfolds across multiple formats and timelines, creating a fragmented narrative puzzle for audiences to piece together.

The universe of MEGAMEAL spans from the primordial moment of creation to the heat death of the universe, with key eras including the Digital Awakening, the Corporate Empire, the Transtemporal Singularity Conflict, and numerous extinction events. Throughout this vast timeline, food remains the constant thread connecting disparate stories and characters.

## THE CONTENT

The MEGAMEAL experience is served across multiple formats:

- **Videos** - Short films and episodes featuring characters like the mysterious figure in prison stripes and a fedora who appears throughout the timeline
- **Articles** - In-universe documents from various eras, including scientific reports, historical analyses, and corporate propaganda
- **Restaurant Reviews** - Culinary explorations of impossible establishments like Ouroboros, where patrons consume portions of themselves
- **Recipes** - Both practical and theoretical, including the legendary Perfect Miranda Bloody Mary that may have broken time itself
- **"Cosmic Cuisine"** - A show-within-the-show featuring culinary adventures across space and time

## HOW TO EXPERIENCE MEGAMEAL

The story is intentionally non-linear, with episodes and content released out of chronological sequence. This fragmented approach mirrors the universe's own disrupted timeline, allowing you to experience the narrative from multiple entry points:

**The Casual Diner:** Start anywhere. Each piece stands alone as its own bizarre culinary adventure.

**The Flavor Explorer:** Follow specific storylines like the Perfect Bloody Mary temporal anomaly, the emergence of the Snuggloids after extinction events, or the catastrophic Spork Uprising that led to nuclear devastation.

**The Deep Diver:** Connect the dots between seemingly unrelated content to uncover the larger narrative about singularities battling across time, cosmic entities that feed on extinction events, and the underlying patterns that connect all moments in spacetime.

## THE BIGGER PICTURE

The overarching story is not immediately apparent, but it is deep and rich. Characters, events, and mysterious entities appear across multiple pieces of content, creating a complex web of connections that rewards careful attention.

The full narrative can only be discovered by experiencing the "world" through different forms of media. While the casual visitor isn't expected to care about the full story, this depth creates a more complete universe that extends beyond the page and screen.

As you engage with more MEGAMEAL content, you'll begin to notice recurring symbols, mysterious figures, and cryptic references that hint at larger cosmic forces at work beneath the surface of seemingly disconnected episodes.

## PROJECT ORIGINS

MEGAMEAL began in October 2024 and continues to evolve. What started as an experimental video has expanded into an ever-growing universe with new episodes, articles, and recipes constantly in development.

Join us as we explore the ultimate question that transcends all eras of cosmic history: 
*What's for dinner at the end of the universe?*

{/* ## BUILT-IN LAYOUT TOGGLE SYSTEM

The layout toggle is now a **built-in site feature**:

- ✅ **Automatic**: Every post gets the toggle button (top-right corner)
- ✅ **Smart Defaults**: Frontmatter `oneColumn: true/false` sets initial state
- ✅ **User Choice**: Readers can switch layouts on any post
- ✅ **No Manual Work**: Authors don't need to add anything to markdown
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: Same experience across all content

### How It Works

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
oneColumn: true   # Starts in single column
---
```

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"  
oneColumn: false  # Starts in two column (default)
---
```

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
# oneColumn not specified = defaults to false (two column)
---
```

The toggle button automatically respects your frontmatter setting as the **initial state**, then lets users choose their preferred layout for that session.
