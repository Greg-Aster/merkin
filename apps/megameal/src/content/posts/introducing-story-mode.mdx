mascotContext: "A story, you say? Oh, I know a few. Stories of digital ghosts whispering in the static, of flavor algorithms that dream of forgotten tastes. This 'game' of yours... does it tell the tale of the consumer consumed? Of the infinite, looping hallway of choices that all lead to the same, inevitable checkout counter? I'm shivering with antici... pation. Let's see if your narrative can escape the event horizon of its own premise. I'll be watching. And judging. With sprinkles."

## A New Way to Experience the Universe

We are thrilled to announce a brand new, interactive way to dive into the world of MegaMeal: **Story Mode**. This is your chance to step directly into the narrative and make choices that shape your journey through our surreal, corporate-dystopian universe.

This new feature is a text-based adventure, allowing you to explore locations, interact with characters, and uncover the secrets lurking behind every MegaMeal product.

## This is a Beta!

Please be aware that Story Mode is currently in **beta**. This means you may encounter bugs, unfinished story paths, or other strange phenomena. Your experience and feedback are incredibly valuable to us as we continue to build and refine this new game element.

We invite you to be among the first to explore this new experience.
