## About the Researcher

**Kaelen Vance** is a xenohistorian of the intelligent pseudopod species, working from his research vessel *Distant Memory* to document the scattered civilizations of the post-Diaspora galaxy. His many tentacles move with deliberate grace through the artifacts and data-slates that fill his warm university study, where he wears a smart tweed jacket and gazes thoughtfully beyond his immediate surroundings.

His kind, intelligent eyes hold a hint of melancholy wonder as he contemplates the vast scales of deep time and the fragments of meaning scattered across the cosmos. This contemplative nature, colleagues noted, seemed to intensify during his later expeditions—as if he sensed something profound awaiting him in the deep silence between stars.

## Research Focus

Kaelen specializes in **Deep Time Xenohistory**—the study of civilizations that emerged after the withdrawal of the Elder Singularities. His work combines rigorous data analysis with philosophical reflection, treating each discovery as both historical evidence and existential meditation.

His current projects include cataloging diaspora civilizations, investigating whether truly alien intelligences represent extreme evolution or independent emergence, and tracing how ancient influences persist in unexpected forms across the galaxy.

## The Selanus Expedition

Kaelen's most significant discovery came during his extended research mission in the Seventh Ring system, where he documented the unique terraformed worlds orbiting Selanus. His detailed ethnographic studies of the local post-human settlements became foundational texts for understanding diaspora adaptation patterns.

It was from Selanus that he transmitted his final field reports—lyrical meditations on meaning and impermanence that many consider his finest work. His description of watching the planet's rings rise over the horizon, shared with his unnamed partner, captured the bittersweet beauty of consciousness contemplating its own fragility across cosmic time.

## The Vanishing

Following reports of an unprecedented discovery in the outer rim systems—what Kaelen described in fragmentary transmissions as "intelligence utterly magnificent in its alienness"—both he and the *Distant Memory* disappeared without trace. His final message, received as a highly degraded signal, contained only the words: "They are neither lost relatives nor strangers. They are something else entirely. Something wonderful."

Extensive search operations found no debris, no distress signals, no evidence of catastrophic failure. The official xenohistorical archives list Dr. Kaelen Vance as "missing, presumed deceased" following first contact with an unknown intelligence, though some colleagues maintain hope that his contemplative nature and diplomatic approach may have earned him a different fate—perhaps one too strange for conventional understanding.

## Legacy

Kaelen's disappearance has only enhanced the poetic resonance of his writings. His final published work, examining the ephemeral nature of meaning across galactic timescales, now reads as an inadvertent epitaph for a scholar who may have discovered the ultimate answer to his central question: whether we are alone in a universe of scattered relatives, or part of something far more vast and unknowable than even the god-minds could comprehend.
